    <p><b>Bio:</b> Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Fahima but my alias is ovofahima because I love Drake! When I'm not coding I'm usually reading, listening to music, hanging out with my best friends, or freestyle rapping. Some of my interests include Black lives matter, soical and political justice, musicals, and feminist theory. This website will be used to express my feelings, concerns, and positive thoughts on all things going on in the world! As well as some pop culture commentary and some coding projects!   </p>

      <b>Side Scroller Project</b><br>
      Last week, I build a cool side scroller project in Scratch. To build it, I learned about storyboarding, graphic design and using the concepts of functions, loops, conditionals, and variables. Check out the screenshot below!<br><br>
